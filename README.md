My choices of textbook is based on print quality (PDF formating) and *free*.
I don't use *paid* textbooks due to the way this allows certain lobbies to put a price on knowledge.
I am extremly thankful and have the outmost respect for the following authors.

- Tom Judson and Rob Beezer
- Boaz Barak
- Mike Rosulek
