    "P.S : I'll trust you'll sci-hub your way to a digital copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pedersen Commitments are a way to commit to a secret value to divulge it later, originally it was used to construct a k-n [Verifiable Secret Sharing] scheme, a **VSS** is a scheme where n-people share a secret with each other such as a k-group from n can reconstruct the secret from their shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "While similar to *Shamir's secret sharing*. Pedersen scheme is verifiable, and non-interactive. This is a consequence of  his commitment scheme the one we're going to talk about.\n",
    "Essentially they can each verify the correctness of their shares without interacting with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cryptographic Commitments\n",
    "\n",
    "A Cryptographic Commitment is a protocol to commit to a message $m$ *secretly* such as a verifier can always verifier the commitment later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol boils down to the following :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Alice picks or is provided a message $m$.\n",
    "2. Alice picks a *random* $r$ and computs $c = C(m,r)$\n",
    "3. Alice publishes $c$\n",
    "4. At some point in the future Alice publishes $(m,r)$\n",
    "5. Bob who wishes to verify Alice's commitment computes $C(m,r)$ and checks equality with the public value $c$\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol holds if $c$ divulges nothing about $m$ (Shannon secrecy), and the probability of finding $(m,r)$ and $(m',r')$ such as $m \\neq m'$ and $C(m,r) = C(m',r')$ is **negligible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pedersen Commitment\n",
    "\n",
    "A Pedersen Commitment uses a group $(G,.)$ of large order $q$ where the DLP is hard.\n",
    "Two random generators $g$ and $h$ are choosen, a random secret $r$ is uniformly picked from $\\mathbb{Z}_q$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "The commitment is :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$C(m,r) = g^m . h^r$**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Protocol Parameters\n",

    "Essentially Elliptic Curves computations are fast, smaller (256-bit vs 2048-bit at the same security level (160 bit I think).\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "Our demo we'll follow the below steps to generate parameters and make some commitments :D\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick a large prime $q$ and $p$ a large safe prime such as $p = 2q + 1$\n",
    "2. Let $h$ a randomly picked generator of cyclic group of order $q$.\n",
    "3. Let $\\alpha$ a randomly picked element of $\\mathbb{Z}_q$ and compute $g = h^\\alpha$\n",
    "4. Let $r$ be our randomly picked secreal seal value from **$\\mathbb{Z}_p$**\n",
    "5. Let $x$ be our commited value we compute $C(x,r) = h^r . g^x$\n",
    "6. A Verifier can later verify this given the commitment bases $(h,g)$ and $(x,r)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One neat consequence here is that $C(x_1,r_1) . C(x_2,r_2) = C(x_1+x_2,r_1+r_2)$ , the proof is left\n",
